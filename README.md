## ModelSelection2
### Follow-up to ModelSelection session: model averaging
 
This is a simple analysis of the Takahe dataset from the appendix in Grueber et al (2011).
The dataset (takahe.csv) is a CSV version of Table S1 in their Appendix.
 
This analysis serves primarily as a demonstration of model averaging, and is not intended to exactly duplicate
Grueber et al's analysis.
